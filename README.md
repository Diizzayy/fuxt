# fuxt3

A complete Headless WordPress tech stack built on Nuxt 3, using GraphQL.

Works best with the [fuxt-backend](https://github.com/funkhaus/fuxt-backend) WordPress theme and included WordPress optimized Vue components.

Built by [Funkhaus](http://funkhaus.us/). We normally host on [Flywheel](https://share.getf.ly/n02x5z).

PS: The name Fuxt comes from [Funkhaus](https://funkhaus.us) and Nuxt. [It's provocative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eRRab36XLI).
